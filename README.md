# React Native FlatList Blank After Async Data Fetch

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component remains blank after successfully fetching data asynchronously.  The problem lies in how the component handles data updates after the initial render.  The solution involves using the `data` prop correctly and ensuring the data is available before rendering the FlatList.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file showcases a FlatList that fetches data from an API.  Despite the data fetching successfully, the list remains blank. The ActivityIndicator displays correctly while loading, but disappears without showing any data items.

## Solution

The solution in `bugSolution.js` addresses this by ensuring the `data` prop is correctly set with the fetched data *before* the FlatList is rendered. Additional error handling is implemented to provide feedback to the user if the data fetch fails.
